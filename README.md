# AI-Based-Calanus-Detection-and-Measurement
This project creates a tool that allows scientists to provide a set of images of Calanus catch samples as input along with a conversion scale, and automatically detects the Calanus in the images and outputs their length in millimeters in text files that can be used for further analysis of size distribution.
